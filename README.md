# cardano-docker
Docker files for setting up Cardano Node environment.

#### Reference

Many steps used in this repository are from resources bellow:

[Cardano Official Documentation](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/index.html)

Thanks to everyone behind CNODE from **cardano-community repository**.

For non-dockerized instructions on how to compile cardano-node on RaspberryPi-4B, I'll refer you to
[Alessandro Konrad Pi-Pool repository](https://github.com/alessandrokonrad/Pi-Pool).

#### !!! Notes !!!

* GHC version: 8.10.4

* Cabal version: 3.4

* All containers running on host network, providing network isolation where possible will
be part of future improvement.

### Building from source 

Since we need our binary to work on Aarch64 architecture, you'll need to build the node from the source files.
I've wrote a Dockerfile that simplify the process.

First, you need to build all required images:
  
1. Set the architecture variable to your requirement (Only x86/amd64 and aarch64 supported):
  
        ARCHITECTURE=<PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE(x86_64 or aarch64)>
        
2. The Cardano sources image:
        
        docker build \
            -t cardano_env:latest \
            ./Dockerfiles/build_env/${ARCHITECTURE}

    ** Tip: _Add `--no-cache` to rebuild from scratch_ **
        
3. Set the version variable (Set the right release VERSION_NUMBER, ie: `1.19.0`)

        VERSION_NUMBER=<VERSION_NUMBER>

4. The node image:

        docker build \
            --build-arg ARCHITECTURE=${ARCHITECTURE} \
            --build-arg RELEASE=${VERSION_NUMBER} \
            -t cardano_node:${VERSION_NUMBER} Dockerfiles/node
     
5. Tag your image with the **latest** tag:

        docker tag cardano_node:${VERSION_NUMBER} cardano_node:latest
                                     
### Node configuration

Now you've created yours images, it's time to create your `config` folder. Your container will bind to this folder,
so you can access your configuration from within.

    mkdir config
    cd config
        
If your OS is unix based, you can use the `wget` utility to download all configuration files from the
[official source](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/index.html).

    wget -O config.json https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/mainnet-config.json
    wget -O byron-genesis.json https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/mainnet-byron-genesis.json
    wget -O shelley-genesis.json https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/mainnet-shelley-genesis.json
    wget -O topology.json https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-deployment/latest-finished/download/1/mainnet-topology.json

#### !!! Important !!!!
We rename them to `byron-genesis.json`, `shelley-genesis.json`, `topology.json` and `config.json` to avoid breaking the script every time they
change the name..! Don't forget to update the reference to the `*-genesis.json` file in your `config.json`.

#### Configuration files permissions

Your user living inside your container need to have access to your configuration file. Add public read permission to all your files under `/config`:

    chmod 644 config/*
   
#### Port configuration
        
Now, if you wish to use the `start-relay.sh` script provided in my repository, add a `port.txt` file under your `/config` 
folder. Your file should contain only one line representing the **PORT** used by your node. 
    
    echo 3000 > port.txt
    
### Relay node configuration

Now you need to configure your `topology.json` file with your Relay and Producer node information.

See: [Configure topology files for block-producing and relay nodes](https://docs.cardano.org/projects/cardano-node/en/latest/stake-pool-operations/core_relay.html).

### Creating the containers with Docker Compose

Docker Compose required `cardano_node`, `cardano_cli` and `cardano_monitor` images.
To build the `cardano_monitor` image, read: [Monitoring with Grafana](Docs/monitoring.md).

You can copy the docker-compose.yaml where your `config/` folder reside. Then start your containers with the 
following command:

    docker-compose --compatibility up -d

** Tips: To start a node as producer instead of relay, swap the comment on `CMD` line in the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
** Tips: --compatibility flag used to support deploy key.
** TIPS: Adjust limit values under deploy to your fit your system available memory to avoid OOM KILL signal.
